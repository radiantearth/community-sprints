# Overview

The sprint runs for 3 days, September 26, 27, and 28th. The main activities will run 9-5 Eastern time (check the
[start time on worldclock](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingdetails.html?year=2019&month=11&day=5&hour=14&min=0&sec=0&p1=263&p2=136&p3=16&p4=224&p5=145) to confirm time difference). Each day we will have a kickoff in the morning
at 9 am as one big group, including the remote attendees. Most work through the sprint will be done in smaller groups, who will work
for a time and then come together to report out and get feedback from other groups. 

### Remote Participation

We aspire to make the sprint as accessible as possible to remote attendees while still making the in-person work as efficient as possible. In the agenda below, any session in **bold** will be a large group, hybrid session and it will be in the 'main' room (with a good video setup). 
As for small-group breakouts, the virtual attendees will have the option to work with other remote attendees, but **the majority of the breakout groups will not be hybrid**. Breakout groups and objectives will be determined each morning. At the end of each day, a full group, hybrid session will be held to report progress made during the day.
