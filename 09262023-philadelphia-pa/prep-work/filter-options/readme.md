## About

One of the major topics at the sprint is to align and make progress on a recommended filter language. The Features API core
has very lightweight filters, but many users want more. STAC has pushed ahead with its own query, while others have adapted
CQL to meet their needs, and experimented with GraphQL.

This space should be used as proposals for those at the sprint to consider. This should help us to hit the ground running, so
that the time is spent examining differences and filling gaps, instead of just trying to commuicate core ideas. Each file
in this directory should be a deep examination of a filter option, so that everyone participating can get a full idea of what
it offers, and what needs improvement. We welcome new ideas, so don't hesitate to add a new option that you'd like to bring to
the table, just be sure to flesh out all the sections and examples that the others have.

Note that we don't need to fully align on exactly **one** filter language, indeed the Features API specification makes it 
quite easy to swap out different ones. But to increase interoperability we should aim for one that can be recommended as the
first one implementors should consider. STAC will likely fully adopt it as required. And we should propose it to be a
'building block' for OGC API's, perhaps even a part of the Commons spec.

## Filter Goals

*The following are draft goals - if any are controversial move them to 'stretch goals'*

* Handle common comparisons for numbers - greater than, greater than or equal to, etc.
* Have at least basic string handling capabilities - starts with, ends with, contains
* Handle logical filters (AND / OR / NOT) so that users can combine other comparisons for more powerful requests
* Handle time to the level that the core Features API spec does (so they can be used in logical filters)
* Supports geometry comparisons - at least intersects/bbox
* Is easily specified and validated, the full core specification should be a few pages
* Draws at least inspiration from existing filtering options that many people know / understand


**Stretch Goals**

Some of these goals should explicitly be in 'extensions' to the core filter specification, so that we have clear specification
of them, but don't require immediate understanding by all users looking at the filter language for the first time.

* Has a mechanism to handle large geometries (larger than can fit in a GET request)
* Support all 9 geometry comparison operations - EQUALS, DISJOINT, INTERSECTS, TOUCHES, CROSSES, WITHIN, CONTAINS, OVERLAPS, RELATE, DWITHIN, BEYOND
* Advanced string handling capabilities - regular expression or ? 
* Advanced time capabilities
* Querying features based on properties of related or nested objects or structured data types (one level & several levels)
* Access to and query of solid geometries and other geometries in a 3D CRS
* Accessing different versions (including historic representations) of features
* Can be represented in BNF notation.

## Filter options

Each of these options should have a page that explains the option in depth, with lots of links. And each should
show how the examples below look in their language, be sure to click on the links for full discussion of the options. 
(OGC CQL + STAC are filled out right now, and can be used as a template for others)

* [OGC CQL](cql-filter-info.md) - Is a nice lightweight filtering language, that a few 
geospatial servers implement today. Currently buried in Catalog specification, could be extracted and updated. Likely should 
use just a subset of it, as its actually quite expansive. Recent proposals include a JSON mapping of the same CQL core.
* [STAC](stac-filter-info.md) - is a clean, easily implementable and very extensible JSON query language inspired by elastic and mongodb.
* GraphQL - See the [GraphQL section of the testbed-14 engineering report](https://docs.opengeospatial.org/per/18-021.html#_graphql)
and sat-api has experimented with this, hopefully Sean Harkins can do a writeup on this. TODO: Make a page to talk about it.
Can likely port a decent bit of Clemens's observations.
* OGC Filter - The core [OGC Filter specification](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/09-026r2/09-026r2.html) likely does
not need a full page here, but is worth reading for context. This is the spec we are attempting to 'upgrade', and hopefully 
subset to a useful core, plus extensions for more advanced features people may want.
* Other inspirations / candidates: https://github.com/araddon/qlbridge/blob/master/FilterQL.md plus mongo's and elastic's 
query languages (which were generally the inspiration for STAC's). TODO: Perhaps just make a single page for people to put 
up what they want to work on.

## Overall Considerations

Each option will have its own considerations, but there are some that are relevant to most any.

**GET vs POST and large geometries** - How do we handle geometries that are too big to fit in a GET request? That pushed
STAC to default to POST, and then use the same JSON query directly in the GET, and we've seen similar things in the past.
Or do we not try to align the two closely, and have a GET that is useful for most things, but specify a more JSON-y post as
an option?

**Multiple filter languages vs default** - How do we let users specify which filter (or query) language they want? And how do
we make a clear default for new users to start with? Do we require one for interoperability? Or just rely on the minimal
bits in WFS core?


## Example operations

These are the operations that potential implementations should write up so that everyone can get a sense of how they are used.

Let's assume a building example like in the core Features API spec, but with a few additional fields:

| Property  | Type | Example|
|-----------|------|---------|
| function | string | "public use" |
| material | string | "brick" |
| owner_name | string | "Mike Jones" |
| floors   | int | 10 |
| swimming_pool | boolean | true |
| taxes    | float | 3404.23 |
| built  | datetime |  2013-12-03T10:15:37 |
| updated | datetime | 2018-10-13T11:23:21 |
|footprint|geometry| <polygon WKT>|

Return all buildings with:

1. Floors greater than 5
2. Taxes less than or equal to 500
3. Owner name contains 'Jones'
4. Owner name starts with 'Mike'
5. Owner name does not contain 'Mike'
6. A swimming pool
7. More than 5 floors and a swimming pool
8. A swimming pool and (more than five floors or material is brick)
9. (More than five floors and material is brick) or swimming pool is true
10. Not under 5 floors or a swimming pool
11. Owner name starts with 'mike' or 'Mike' and is less than 4 floors
12. Built before 2015
13. Built after June 5, 2012
14. Updated between 7:30am June 10, 2017 and 10:30am June 11, 2017
15. Location in the box between -118,33.8 and -117.9,34 in lat/long (geometry 1)
16. Geometry that intersects with geometry 2 (below)
17. More than 5 floors and is within geometry 1 (below)

TODO: Add more complex filters that may stretch things or at least illustrate how different filters work.
