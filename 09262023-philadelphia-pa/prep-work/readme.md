# About

This directory is a workspace to collaborative prepare for the STAC sprint. Everyone is welcome
to edit files and make new workspaces - just make a PR and we will get your information into main. Work will also take place 
in other repositories that are specific to the STAC specifications or ecosystem; this space just serves as very lightweight collaboration space 
with a low barrier to entry.

# Meetings to Attend

There are a handful of STAC meetings occuring in the time leading up to the STAC. We encourage STAC sprint attendees to make as many of the upcoming meetings as possible to get everyone as up to speed as possible before the sprint.

#### STAC Community Meeting

General meeting about all things stac-spec and stac-api-spec. Meeting consists of (1) intros and updates from each meeting participant and (2) agenda items (created by anyone that attends the meeting).

**Meeting time:** every other Monday from 11 am - 12 pm EST (1-hour long meeting)

- Monday, August 14th @ 11 am EST

- Monday, August 28th @ 11 am EST

- Monday, September 11th @ 11 am EST

#### STAC Working Session

A two-hour meeting that allows us to dive into a specific task and get some work done while all online. The agenda is preset by the STAC PSC and there are no intros/updates/check-ins. 

**Meeting time:** 1st Tuesday of the month from 11 am - 1 pm EST (2-hour long meeting)

- Tuesday, September 5th @ 11 am EST

#### STAC Ecosystem (stac-utils) Meeting

These meetings are relatively new, but have proven helpful to the community. The format of this meeting is similar to that of the STAC Community meeting, but instead of dicussing the specifications themselves (stac-spec and stac-api-spec), this meeing dicusses work being done/needed for the tools built to help interact with STAC.

**Meeting time:** occational Monday's from 11 am - 12 pm EST (1-hour long meeting)



# Topics

There are three main categories of topics, and each has their own page or directory to go deeper on. These should serve
to get people working on the topic on the same page before the sprint. Each should have a number of links to give a newer
user the appropriate background and should attempt to frame the major points of decision. These will likely be various
degrees of WIP (work in progress), as everyone is too busy ahead of the sprint, but something started is better than nothing.

* **[Implementations](implementation-topics.md)** - The goal of these sprints is to build - software, hosted datasets, testing 
tools, etc - with the specification being a side-effect of people working together. So if people are not sure where to 
contribute then jumping on this area is one of the best. The [implementations page](implementations.md) details the various 
projects people are working on, as well as ideas of new datasets / software, and you can also offer up your skills there. 
Testing and validation is also a part of this. It includes both STAC and Features API projects.

* **[Specification Topics](specification-topics.md)** - Since we are bringing together both STAC and OGC API communities, the 
primary goal is to work on topics that are relevance for both groups. So all of these should be detailed ahead of time
as much as possible. The STAC community will also have a set of topics that they aim to tackle. And we will also provide
a space for OGC API - Catalogue, as it aligns so closely aligns, and 5 of 8 members of the SWG will be participating.

* **[Outreach & Education](outreach-and-education-topics.md)** - The third major topic is outreach, broadly defined. How do we get more people aware
of STAC? How do we help those who have just learned about STAC dive into using the specification and tooling around it? Past sprints have done
things like create the http://stacspec.org website. There are LOTS
more improvements possible on stacspec.org. Developing tutorials for individuals with a wide range of familiarity with STAC is needed.
