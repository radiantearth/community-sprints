# Overview

One of the areas engineers most often underinvest in is communicating with the world about their work. It is a clear goal of
STAC to communicate and educate well. For this set of topics we also appreciate any brainstorming 
and creative ideas on how we can get the word out to diverse audiences more, so feel free to propose more.

## Tutorials/Guides

It is crutial for the expanded adoption of STAC to improve the education ecosystem.

The current STAC official tutorials can be found at [stacspec.org/en/tutorials](https://stacspec.org/en/tutorials/).

More resources can be found at [stacindex.org](https://stacindex.org/).

### STAC Users

**Ideas for tutorials:**

- Browsing STAC Catalogs
- ...

### STAC Developers

**Ideas for tutorials:**

- Using datasets that have STAC Catlaogs to search and perform analysis using stac ecosystem tooling (stac-utils)
- ...

### Data Providers

**Ideas for tutorials:**

- Building STAC Catalogs
- ...

## Best Practices Document Improvements 

The best practice documents: 
- stac-spec [best-practices.md](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/best-practices.md)
- No best practices document for STAC API (yet) -- should we be creating one?

## STAC Website (stacspec.org) Improvements
The STAC website is a github repo at https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-site. Tackling any of the 
[issues raised](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-site/issues) would be a great help. There are also a number of other
things that are deserving of tickets that haven't been written up yet, but would be awesome to do:

* Add more tools, see [#23](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-site/issues/23) - but ideally we should talk to everyone
at the sprint to make sure we're not missing any tools there.
* Better 'stac in action' section. There are more repositories that are up to speed that would be good to include. This should
also include hosted API instances that people are relying upon (though I think we don't want to have too many that just have
landsat in them).
* [sat-api-browser](https://github.com/sat-utils/sat-api-browser) improvements.
* Mirror the STAC Best Practices document on the site
* Mirror the STAC Specification on the site
* Survey all the previous talks / podcasts that have been given on STAC and put links to them on the website. For example 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emXgkNutUTo, and then the ARD conference has also had STAC talks each year, and recorded them.

### Improved Frequently Ased Questions Page 

During the past two STAC working sessions, the attendees have been building an improved list of STAC FAQs. The current STAC FAQ page is neither up to date nor all encompassing to represent beginer's STAC questions. This page is often where people first go, so we want to make sure the document is top-notch. 

You can find this document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gM_189NDaDAg7xvNb4R_OhZVcRdquACoHgcaYuuF4hc/edit).

Please feel free to add to responses and add additional questions.

## Presentations

Creating the equivalent of a 'corporate deck' could be a big win - a set of great looking slides that tell the main story. 
This could be customized as needed by the presenter, but it'd be great to give people a great starting point. This is needed
for both STAC and OGC API (features and in general).

It'd also be great to brainstorm on different audiences we'd like to present to, and try to come up with a calendar of events
to hit, and a distributed set of speakers who can attend and talk. This should include podcasts and webinars.
