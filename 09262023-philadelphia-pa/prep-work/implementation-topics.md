## Testing and Validation

* STAC Validator / STAC Lint
  * [https://github.com/s22s/stac-api-validator](https://github.com/s22s/stac-api-validator)
  * Discussion needed: [Validators report STAC as valid although it is not truly valid](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/discussions/1242)

## STAC Implementation 

Create or improve a STAC Catalog. 

Get more data that is publicly available as a STAC catalog, or enhance an existing one. Enhancements include getting
a STAC Browser, custom-styling a STAC Browser, indexing in a STAC API, and getting it working with clients like QGIS,
[sat-api-browser](https://github.com/sat-utils/sat-api-browser), sat-search, etc.
