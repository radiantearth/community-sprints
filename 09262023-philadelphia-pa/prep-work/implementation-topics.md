## STAC Implementation - create or improve a compliant Catalog

Get more data that is publicly available as a STAC catalog, or enhance an existing one. Enhancements include getting
a STAC Browser, custom-styling a STAC Browser, indexing in a STAC API, and getting it working with clients like QGIS,
[sat-api-browser](https://github.com/sat-utils/sat-api-browser), sat-search, etc.

### Potential Data to stand-up

 * *Add dataset here*

## Testing and Validation

* STAC Validator / STAC Lint
    * [https://github.com/s22s/stac-api-validator]
    * Discussion needed: [Validators report STAC as valid although it is not](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/discussions/1242)
